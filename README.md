# TwoPlayer-DiceGame

This GitHub repository hosts a fun and interactive two-player dice game that spans across 5 exciting rounds. In each round, both players take turns rolling dice, aiming to score as high as possible. The game tracks the number of rounds won by each player, and the ultimate winner is determined by the player with the most round victories.

# How It Works:

Players take turns rolling dice, with each player allowed 3 rolls per round. The game keeps score of each player's current round score and total round wins. After each round, the winner is declared based on their scores. The game continues for 5 rounds, and the overall winner is determined based on the number of rounds won.

# What I Learned:

Creating this game allowed me to enhance my JavaScript skills, including: Handling game logic and user input. Working with the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the web page. Implementing conditional statements for score tracking and round management. Utilizing random number generation to simulate dice rolls.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and enjoy playing this two-player dice game with a friend!
